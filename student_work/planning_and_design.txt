Part I: Planning & Design (15 pts)

* Decide on a game idea and core goal
* Game rules and player actions are written or sketched out
* Main objects (player, obstacles, goals, enemies, etc.) are identified
* Sketch a simple plan showing how the game will work step-by-step

Game Idea:
Flappy Bird dupe (Floppy Duck)

Game Rules:
Hit an obstacle = die 
Every square survived = 1 score point added
High score = 999 (game ends at 999)

Major Game Elements:
Duck emoji (as playable bird), periodic and random obstacles, score counter

Gameplay Process:
Player hits space to keep bird in air, dies if an obstacle is hit
